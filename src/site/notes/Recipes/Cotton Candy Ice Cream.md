# Cotton Candy Ice Cream
### Ingredients
- 2 ¼ cups coconut cream[^1]
- ¼ cup cashew butter
- ½ cup pure maple syrup
- 1 ½ tsp almond extract
- 1 tsp pure vanilla
- ¼ tsp Spirulina Powder, blue
- 2 tsp dragonfruit
### Instructions
1. Process your ingredients, minus colorants, together until smooth
2. Divide in half
3. Stir in blue spirulina powder into one half
4. Stir in 2 tsp dragonfruit juice (I had frozen dragonfruit that I muddled to get juices out). You can also use .5-1 tsp of dragonfruit powder or freeze dried raspberry powder. 
5. Pour into ice cube tray or silicone mini muffin liner and freeze for 3 hours or until firm to touch
6. Blend each color into thick and creamy
7. Alternately dolllop blue and pink dollops of ice cream into a 9x5 loaf tin, give a gentle swirl (not too much or you'll blend into purple), and place in the freezer another 3+ hours
8. Scoop and enjoy!
9. Keep stored, covered in the freezer
10. If thawed for 10min it's more soft serve consistency, or more ice cream like if eaten right out of the freezer.

[^1]: Coconut cream is just the thick part- do not use the watery coconut milk. If not dairy free you can use heavy cream in place of the coconut cream, sunbutter or even frozen banana in place of the cashew butter.
