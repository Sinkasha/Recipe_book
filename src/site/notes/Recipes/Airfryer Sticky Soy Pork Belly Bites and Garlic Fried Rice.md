![Airfryer Sticky Soy Pork Belly Bites.png|400](/img/user/Images/Airfryer%20Sticky%20Soy%20Pork%20Belly%20Bites.png)
### Ingredients
##### Pork
- 400g pork belly, cut into 1-2 inch pieces  
- 2 tbsp honey  
- 1 tbsp brown sugar  
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce  
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce  
- ¼ - ½ tsp Chinese five spice  
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce  
- ¼ tsp black pepper  
- 2 tsp garlic paste  
- ¼ tsp salt  
- 1 tsp shaoxing wine  
- 1 tbsp honey (for basting) 
##### Rice
- Enough garlic until your ancestors say stop (I used a whole head hehe), minced  
- 2 tbsp neutral oil  
- 2 spring onion, minced (whites and greens separate)  
- 2 cups of cooked rice
- ½ tsp msg
- ½ tsp sugar 
- 1 tsp light soy sauce  
##### Toppings
- Greens of spring onion
- Minced chives
- Crispy garlic pieces
- Egg yolk

### Instructions
1. In a bowl, add all the marinade ingredients for the pork belly (excluding the 1 tbsp of honey) mix and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes  
2. During this time you can cook your rice (but best to use day old rice for the fried rice)  
3. In a pan, add oil and fry the garlic on medium-low heat to brown the garlic. When it starts to turn golden brown, strain the oil into a bowl, making sure to reserve the crispy garlic pieces. (the garlic will continue to cook once you strain so don’t let it brown too much in the pan)  
4. Once the pork has finished marinating, add into an air fryer basket (reserving the extra marinade in the bowl) and cook at 180ºC for 20 minutes or until cooked, making sure to take out and baste with extra marinade mixed with 1 tbsp of honey every 5 minutes until glossy, brown and crispy)  
5. In the same pan the garlic was fried, over high heat, add the reserve garlic oil followed by the whites of the spring onion, stir fry for a few seconds until aromatic and begins to soften)  
6. Add in the cooked rice and give it a mix. Then go in with the seasonings. Mix, taste and adjust to liking.  
7. Add back in little bit more than half of the crispy garlic into the rice and mix then plate up. Use remaining garlic as garnish and top with pork belly.
