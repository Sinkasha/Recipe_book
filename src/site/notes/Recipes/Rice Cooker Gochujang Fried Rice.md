# Rice Cooker Gochujang Fried Rice
![Rice Cooker Gochujang Fried Rice.png|400](/img/user/Images/Rice%20Cooker%20Gochujang%20Fried%20Rice.png)
### Ingredients
- 1 cup of rice (I use medium-grain rice. Use about 2 tablespoons less than the regular amount of water you normally use when cooking rice. For me, that’s 1:1 ratio but it differs between rice cookers and rice)
- 2 tbsp gochujang (adjust to your desired spice level)
- 2-3 boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup peas & carrots
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp ginger, minced
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
### Instructions
1. Begin by washing your rice. In the rice cooker, add the rice and water, garlic, ginger, and gochujang.  
2. Use your rice cooker paddle to mix the gochujang with the rice (it’s ok if there’s still chunks of gochujang).  
3. Place the chicken pieces on top of the rice mixture, followed by the peas & carrots.  
4. Close the rice cooker lid and cook on the regular white rice setting until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender (this takes me ~20-25 minutes but varies between rice cookers).  
5. Once done, crack your two eggs and add your soy sauce and sesame oil. Fluff the rice to combine all the ingredients and enjoy.
