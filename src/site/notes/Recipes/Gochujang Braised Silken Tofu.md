# Gochujang Braised Silken Tofu
### Ingredients
- 1 400g tube egg tofu or silken tofu[^1]
- 1-2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 green onions, greens and whites separated, white finely chipped, greens thinly sliced
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1.5 tbsp gochujang paste
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp mirin
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp water
- + sesame oil for drizzling
### Instructions
1. Cut tofu into 1cm thick pieces and sprinkle each side with cornstarch, I like to use a fine mesh sieve to make things easier.
2. In a small bowl, stir together gochujang, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, sesame oil and water.
3. Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add tofu pieces, frying on each side until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove tofu onto a plate
4. In the same pan, using the residual oil, add green onion whites and garlic and fry for 1-2 minutes. Add back in tofu and distribute over the surface of the pan, then pour over the gochujang sauce. Let it bubble and thicken as your gently shake the pan to coat the tofu, and gently flip each tofu piece so that both sides get coated. Turn off the heat once the sauce has thickened and the tofu is coated, this should only take about a minute or so.
5. Drizzle the tofu with some sesame oil and sprinkle the green onion greens overtop. Serve with rice and steamed veggies of your choice. I like edamame or broccoli. I also like topping this with toasted sesame seeds.

[^1]: Soon tofu (i.e. tofu for sundubu-jjigae that comes in a tube) works here, just make sure it’s not the extra soft kind or it will easily fall apart. The rectangular containers of silken tofu will work too, just use the same amount (400g) and cut into rectangular slabs. Overall, you’ll want to opt for a silken tofu that’s as firm as possible.
