# Shallot and Garlic Bread
![Shallot and Garlic Bread.png|400](/img/user/Images/Shallot%20and%20Garlic%20Bread.png)
### Ingredients
- 1 loaf of any Italian bread (I used Pane de Casa)  
- 3 shallots  
- 2 garlic bulbs  
- 125g butter, softened  
- 1 tbsp miso  
- ½ tbsp chili flakes  
- Cheese (i used a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan)  
- Parsley, chopped 
- 1-2 tbsp honey
### Instructions
1. Chop the tops off of the garlic bulbs and shallots. Place them on a piece of foil, drizzle generously with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold up the piece of foil and bake at 180C / 350F for 1hr – 1hr15min or until the garlic and shallots are golden and caramelized. Leave to cool.
2. In a bowl, squeeze out the garlic and shallots. Add butter, miso, chili flakes, salt and pepper, and mix well until combined.
3. Slice your loaf of bread in half lengthwise and spread over the mixture generously (you can also make slits in your bread to let the butter better seep through). Top with cheese and grill/broil at 180C / 350F for 15-20 mins or until golden brown (remember to keep an eye on it and don’t let it burn!).
4. Once golden and crunchy, top with parsley and honey. Slice to serve.
