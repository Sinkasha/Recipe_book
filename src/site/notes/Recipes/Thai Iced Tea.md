# Thai Iced Tea
*This makes a really large jar of thai iced tea*
### Ingredients
- 4 cups of Thai tea leaves (I use [**THIS**](https://amzn.to/3WsBc66) brand) with a ratio of 1:8 tea leaves to water
- 4 cups of condensed milk
- 1/2 gallon of half and half (or until you reach the desired “orange” of Thai milk teas - make sure to not overdo!)
### Instructions
1. Seep Thai tea leaves in boiling water at a ratio of 1:8 (I made mine with 4 cups of Thai tea leaves to 32 cups of boiling water)
2. Add sweetened condensed milk to taste (I added 4 cups for the 32 cups of water)
3. Add in as much half and half as you need to reach the desired color of “Thai tea orange”, I used half a gallon of half and half
4. Mix well and top off with ice
5. Serve in a large dispenser like [**THIS**](https://amzn.to/3SBPa4n) one
