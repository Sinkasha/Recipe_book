# Honey Lemon Aiyu Jelly
![Honey Lemon Aiyu Jelly.png|400](/img/user/Images/Honey%20Lemon%20Aiyu%20Jelly.png)
### Ingredients
- 250 g whole lemons ~4 lemons, sliced
- 250 g honey ~¾ cup
- 1 packet aiyu seeds
- hard (mineral) water amount according to aiyu instructions (750mL per 10g aiyu)
	- Use hard water of at least 100+ ppm. The seeds need minerals (measured by hardness) to properly gel. You can check your local tap water hardness or use bottled mineral water if it’s too low. Do not use filtered or distilled water.
	- Make sure there is no oil or grease on the containers you’re using. Wash your hands before agitating the aiyu seeds.
	- Don’t add sugar until the gel sets, use only water to activate.
- Passionfruit seeds optional
### Instructions
1. **One day in advance**: in a pint size jar or container, combine the lemons and honey. Stir to coat then cover with a lid and reserve in the refrigerator overnight to macerate. Don't worry if it's thick, honey will draw out moisture from the lemon to form a flavorful syrup.
2. Wash your hands and prepare the aiyu seeds by placing them in a teabag or cheesecloth tied off with string. In a large bowl, add water (see note) and the packet of aiyu seeds. Submerge and massage the seeds for 5 minutes by agitating the bag with your hands.
3. Remove and discard the bag of aiyu seeds. Set the bowl aside at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, until a jelly forms.
4. To serve in a bowl, spoon the aiyu jelly into your serving bowl. Spoon over a couple tablespoons of honey lemon syrup and passionfruit seeds if using. To serve in a glass, spoon the aiyu jelly until half full and top with a couple tablespoons of honey lemon syrup and passionfruit seeds if using. Top remaining space with equal parts ice and water. Sip with a wide straw (the ones for boba are ideal). Give it a stir, taste and add more honey lemon syrup if desired.
5. Store any extra aiyu jelly in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It's normal for water to slowly "leak" from the jelly as its gelling power weakens over time. Any extra honey lemon syrup keeps in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. It's also excellent mixed with hot water for a quick cup of honey lemon tea.
