# Spam Onigiri
![Spam Onigiri.png|400](/img/user/Images/Spam%20Onigiri.png)
### Ingredients
- 3-4 cups cooked rice short-grain or medium-grain rice
- ½ can (170g) Spam Lite diced to ¼ inch cubes, substitute with regular Spam and reduce soy sauce by ½ the original value
- 2 scallion chopped
- 3 tbsp furikake
- 2 roasted seaweed sheets cut into 2 inch strips
##### Sauce
- 2 tbsp sugar adjust to taste
- 1 tbsp soy sauce adjust to taste
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 2 tsp sesame oil
### Instructions
1. Dice Spam into 1/4 inch thick cubes. Set aside for later.
2. In a small mixing bowl, combine sugar, soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Mix well.
3. Heat a medium-sized non-stick pan over medium heat. Toss in the Spam and cook until all sides are browned, about 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Pour in the sauce from earlier then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until most of the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. The sauce should be thick and sticky.
5. Turn off the heat then add scallions. Mix until well combined then transfer to a bowl.
6. Place the cooked rice into a bowl and allow the rice to cool to the touch.
7. To form the onigiri, you can use a mold like I did or shape it by hand. If using a mold, follow the instructions according to the package.
   
   If shaping by hand, wet both hands and using two fingers, dip it in the bowl with salt. Rub the salt into the palm of your hands until evenly coated. Grab about 1/4 cup rice and flatten it out on the palm of your hand. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the crab-filling mixture in the center. Top with some more rice and press it down so the rice on top sticks to the rice on the bottom. [^1] Using your palms, apply pressure and shape the onigiri into a triangle. To create a triangle shape, make the palm of one hand flat and make a 90-degree angle with the other hand. Shape the rice ball using this formation while rotating. Be sure to apply pressure when shaping! This may take some practice and a few tries.
8. Carefully coat the edges of the onigiri in furikake seasoning. Wrap in a seaweed sheet right before serving and enjoy!
