# Honey Chili Lotus Chips
### Ingredients
- 1-2 lotus stem tubers, sliced thin
- 1 tsp red chili powder
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp veggie oil
### For the glaze
- 1 tbsp chili oil
- ½ tbsp honey
### For the chili oil
- 2 medium red onions, thinly sliced
- 1 head of garlic, separated into cloves, sliced
- 1½ cups vegetable oil
- 2 3” cinnamon sticks
- 6 star anise pods
- 1 2” piece ginger, peeled, very finely chopped
- ¼ cup crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 tsp. sugar
### Instructions
1. Start by peeling the tubers and chop them into two halves. Cut the bottoms and wash the tubers thoroughly. Slice on the sharpest setting on the mandolin. If you are cutting with a knife, I suggest soaking the chips in warm water for 30 minutes to par-cook the chips.
2. In a bowl, add the chips along with the spices and oil (from the glaze). Mix well.
3. Preheat your air fryer to 180$\degree$C and place the chips in batches into the basket. Space the chips to prevent layering. This will reduce the chances of chips getting soggy. Keep in the fryer for 12 minutes. Check-in once at the 6-minute mark.
4. For the homemade chili oil, put the thinly sliced ginger, crushed red pepper flakes, sugar, and soy sauce in a bowl. Mix well. 
5. In a pan / pot, while over medium heat, put the oil, garlic, onion, star anise pods, and cinnamon sticks in. Cook for 18 - 25 min, until all the ingredients brown up. 
6. Sieve the hot oil over the dry ingredients (the one with the crushed red pepper flakes). Mix. Put the sieved out ingredients into the oil. 
7. Once fried, let the chips cool for 5 minutes, and then in bowl, mix well with honey and chili oil. 
8. Finish with a garnish of sesame seeds and spring onions.
